The Game Management System allows users to efficiently manage game details such as name, description, category, devices, and cover images. Administrators can edit and update game information, including associating games with multiple devices (e.g., PC, PlayStation) and changing cover images. The system ensures data consistency with real-time validation and dynamic dropdowns for categories and devices. It leverages ASP.NET Core MVC with Entity Framework Core for data management and supports file uploads for cover images. The system provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to easily update and maintain game data across different devices.
